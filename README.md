### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Conda
- MySQL
- Elasticsearch

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   conda create -n videosearch python=3.8
   conda activate videosearch
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Database Setup**
   - Install and configure MySQL.
   - Create a database and necessary tables as described in the project documentation.

5. **Elasticsearch Setup**
   - Install and configure Elasticsearch.
   - Ensure it is running before starting the application.

## Usage

### Indexing Video Content
1. **Prepare Video Files**: Place your video files in the specified directory.
2. **Run Indexing Script**: Execute the script to analyze videos and create indexes.
   ```bash
   python index_videos.py
   ```
3. **Verify Indexes**: Check the MySQL database and CSV files to ensure indexes are correctly created.

### Querying Videos
1. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. **Use the GUI**: Enter search terms in the GUI to retrieve video segments based on text labels.
3. **Review Results**: The system displays matching video frames along with their labels, timestamps, and confidence scores.

### Video Playback
1. **Select Video Segment**: Choose the desired video segment from the search results.
2. **Play Video**: Click the 'Play Video' button to start playback from the specified timestamp.

## Architecture
### System Design
- **Data Model**: 
  - `label` (text): Label of objects identified in each video frame.
  - `frame_index` (integer): Frame number where each object is recognized.
  - `time_stamp` (float): Exact time each object appears in the video.
  - `confidence` (float): Confidence score of the object detection.

### Functionality
- **Index Creation**: YOLOv5 analyzes video frames, extracts object labels, and stores data in MySQL and CSV files.
- **Search and Retrieval**: Combines Elasticsearch and spaCy to process search queries and retrieve relevant video segments.
- **Video Playback**: Uses OpenCV to play video segments from specific timestamps within the GUI.

## Optimization Strategies
- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilize NVIDIA CUDA to speed up object detection.
- **Batch Processing**: Implement batch processing for efficient MySQL data insertion.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Enhance GUI responsiveness by performing asynchronous database queries.
- **Results Caching**: Cache frequent query results to reduce database load and improve query speed.
- **Index Creation**: Optimize database indexing to speed up search queries.

## Future Work
- **Distributed Architecture**: Implement a distributed system to enhance scalability.
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Improve the GUI for better user interaction.
- **Additional Features**: Add functionalities such as video upload and automatic indexing.

## Conclusion
This project successfully integrates advanced object detection and query optimization technologies to create a powerful video content retrieval system. By continuously improving the system's performance and user experience, it aims to set a new standard for video content analysis.
